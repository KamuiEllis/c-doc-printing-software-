I attempting to create a website that gives students the ability to upload files and send it to the school printer.
So i created a separate C# program to understand how each document such as pdfs, word, powerpoint etc works and how to 
communicate with any sort of printer using c#. Although this is not perfect and i was only able to print a handfull of 
documents, it works.

How to use:
Run the exe file to run the program, click the button in the middle and select the file you want to print.
